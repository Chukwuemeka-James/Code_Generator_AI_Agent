# **Code Generator AI Agent**  

Code Generator AI Agent is an intelligent system that reads API documentation and generates code based on user prompts. It leverages LlamaIndex, Ollama models (Mistral & CodeLlama), and structured parsing techniques to ensure high-quality AI-driven code generation.  

## **Features**  
 **Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation** – Uses semantic search over API documentation for accurate results.  
 **Multi-Agent Architecture** – Incorporates ReActAgent for advanced reasoning.  
 **Pydantic Output Parsing** – Ensures structured JSON-based code responses.  
 **Support for Multiple File Types** – Handles `.pdf` documentation for API reference.  
 **Automatic File Saving** – Stores generated code in an `output` directory.
